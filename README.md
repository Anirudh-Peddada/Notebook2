# Notebook
This repository contains notebooks for education and data science purposes.

## Python
Python is the first content in this series where I have covered the fundamental concepts associated while working with Python, the loop holes that you need to watch out, a brief overview of Pandas and Numpy, and assignments as well.

The contents covered in each of these Python Notebooks are as follows:

__Beginner__
```
|_What is Python, Why do we need it, applications, who uses it
|_Numerical and Boolean Operations
|_Datatypes and Type Conversion
|_Variables and object
|_Standard libraries and Importing modules
|_String, String Operation and String formatting
|_Useful pythonic functions (string: join, replace; numeric: max, sum, abs)
|_User Input
|_User Defined Function
```

__Intermediate Part 1__
```
|_More Data Types
  |_List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary and its operations
  |_List slicing
  |_List and dictionary comprehension
|_Conditional statements, range, loops
|_File I/O
```

__Intermediate Part 2:__
```
|_Class, Inheritance
|_Exception Handling, finally
|_Lambda
|_First-class Function - Map & Filter
|_Iterators, generators
|_Useful pythonic functions for iterables (any, enumerate)
```

__Advanced - Pandas__
```
|_Importing Data
|_Creating Test Object
|_Viewing Data
|_Data Cleaning
|_Selection
|_Filter, Sort & Group by
|_Iteration
|_Join, Merging
|_Statistics & Visualization
|_Exporting Data
```

__Advanced - Numpy__

|_Indexing, slicing & advanced indexing
|_Arithmetic, Mathematical & Statistical operations
|_Iteration over array
|_Broadcasting
|_I/O operations
```
Over the course of time, I will keep on adding more contents in this repo.
